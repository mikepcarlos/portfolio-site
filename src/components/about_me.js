                My name is Michael Carlos. I’m a Full Stack Web Developer with an interest in music production and small electronics engineering. In my world, there’s nothing that can start the day off better than a fluffy everything bagel with whipped cream cheese. My guilty pleasure video games are Kingdom Hearts and Pokemon. I graduated Mercy College with a Bachelors of Science in Music Industry and Technology. Throughout my college career I was president of our AES club. Being president allowed me the opportunity to organize weekly events. These events helped cultivate an interest in soldering for me. I first thought it would be a valuable skill to have, knowing how to solder and fix a broken cable. This interest soon developed into a hobby of mine. This lead me to start building synthesizers. My background has afforded me many opportunities. Some of which being an Assistant Studio Manager and Stage Hand. Although I loved what I did, there was always a part of me that felt I wasn’t always scratching that itch. I began my interest with music production and audio solely on my computer years before venturing into hardware equipment. No matter how deep into the rabbit hole I fell with hardware I always found my way back to my computer. It was this that made me realize that coding might be the way I can finally scratch my itch. I began to see that it wasn’t working with music that made me feel attracted to my previous professions. It was the ability to think creatively and technically in the same environment. Not only does coding provide me that same opportunity but it also encourages me to continue learning new technologies. In every project I undergo I’m given the ability to ask myself how I can make this easy and attractive for someone with a completely different perspective. I aspire for everything I help create to translate to everyone.
